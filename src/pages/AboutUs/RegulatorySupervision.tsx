              LEI Bloomberg Finance LP is an accredited issuer of the Legal
              Entity Identifier (LEI). As a Local Operating Unit (LOU) of the
              Global Legal Entity Identifier System, it has been accepted for
              global use and has become a reporting requirement for several
              market regulators and authorities. Corsa Group Intervest LTD is
              fully compliant under LEI via LEI Bloomberg Finance LP with the
              following details:
              <br />
              Legal Entity Name: Corsa Group Intervest LTD
              <br />
              LEI Number: 5493001KJTIIGC8Y1R12
            </p>
            <p className="certificate-text-description">
              The BLOOMBERG LEI is designed to uniquely identify legal entities
              that are participants in financial transactions, thereby helping
              to create greater transparency in the marketplace. The standard
              for this identifier and its associated reference data has been
              established in ISO 17442. It has been accepted for global use and
              has become a reporting requirement for several market regulators
              and authorities. Most notably, the LEI has been a requirement of
              MiFID I for all counterparties to transactions. In addition,
              several regulatory authorities in countries outside Europe also
              already require financial counterparties to obtain an LEI for
              various trade and transaction reporting activities The Securities
              Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR) will obligate
              participants to meet requirements for LEI registration. The
              intention of the regulation is to promote transparency in the
              financial system, specifically of the securities financing
              transaction market.
