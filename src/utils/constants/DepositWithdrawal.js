                      The availability of deposited funds in your account may vary. Processing times differ based on the deposit method, with some being 
                      nearly instantaneous and others taking longer to complete. For specific details, consult the table above for a breakdown of the processing 
                      durations associated with each deposit mode.

                      While we do not impose any fees or commissions on deposits or withdrawals, it’s important to be aware that banks may apply their own 
                      charges for transactions, especially in the case of bank transfers. Additionally, for e-wallets, withdrawal fees may apply if no trading 
                      activity has taken place.

                        At Corsa Futures, our clients enjoy industry-leading rates, ensuring competitive advantages. When making deposits from an external 
                        funding source or processing withdrawals to an external funding source, funds will be converted based on the
                        prevailing daily bank rate.

                        Kindly allow a grace period of up to 10 minutes for the funds to reflect in your account. Should the process take longer than expected,

                        Certainly, you can proceed with the transfer to a different bank account if it is registered under the same name as your account 
                        with Corsa Futures. However, please note that if there is a discrepancy in names (e.g., company name vs. personal name), we are unable to 
                        facilitate the transfer due to stringent Anti-Money Laundering policies.
